# Tia Anderson – Portfolio

Welcome! I'm **Tia Anderson**, a software engineer who made the leap from SaaS onboarding and implementation to full-stack development. This is my personal portfolio site — a space that blends my technical growth, personality, and proof of what I’m capable of when given the right tools and a bit of curiosity.

## 🌿 About This Portfolio

Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this site is fully responsive and reflects the soft, earthy aesthetic of my Peace of Mind (POM) app — a Rails application I designed and deployed from the ground up. The site includes:

- A visually engaging landing page
- A featured section highlighting my flagship app: [Peace of Mind](https://github.com/Miss-Tia/pom-app)
- A fully styled resume page (with PDF download)
- Contact section with LinkedIn integration and working message form
- Mobile-optimized design and subtle animations

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- HTML5 + CSS3 (Flexbox & Grid Layouts)
- JavaScript
- Git & GitHub
- AOS (Animate on Scroll)
- Deployed via GitHub Pages

## 🧠 What Sets Me Apart

I pivoted into software engineering after 10+ years of working in customer-facing SaaS roles. I’m not just learning to code — I’m applying it. I’ve already built and deployed multiple projects, completed a full Ruby on Rails course, and was selected as a **RailsConf 2025 Scholar** based on my potential.
