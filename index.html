        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hello! I am Tia Anderson, a passionate learner, noticer, tinkerer and aspiring software engineer. I enjoy digging in and learning what makes software and webpages work the way they do, along with creating them. When I'm not coding, I love cooking, gardening, and exploring new technologies. I currently work in tech, but not the area I'm aiming for yet. </p>
